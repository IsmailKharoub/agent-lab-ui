# Frontend Implementation Guide for Agent Details Page

## Overview

This implementation guide provides comprehensive instructions for updating the frontend Agent Details page to work with our latest backend enhancements. The page should now display URLs, screenshots, statistics, and other artifacts collected during agent execution.

## Key Backend Enhancements

1. **URL Tracking**: Agent logs now include the URL being visited during each step
2. **Screenshot Capture**: Screenshots are now captured and stored for each significant step
3. **Statistics API**: A new `/api/v1/agents/:id/stats` endpoint provides comprehensive metrics
4. **Static Files**: The `/uploads` directory now serves static files, accessible via `/uploads/*` paths

## Guide Structure

This guide is divided into four parts, each focusing on a specific component of the Agent Details page:

1. [**Part 1: Agent Status Component**](./frontend-implementation-guide-part1.md)
   - Updated status display with progress indication
   - New statistics panel with metrics (duration, pages visited, etc.)
   - Action buttons with appropriate visibility logic

2. [**Part 2: Agent Logs Component**](./frontend-implementation-guide-part2.md)
   - Enhanced log entries with URL display
   - Screenshot viewing capability
   - Improved pagination and filtering

3. [**Part 3: Browser Session Timeline**](./frontend-implementation-guide-part3.md)
   - New timeline view showing the agent's browsing journey
   - URL-based organization of activities
   - Visual representation of the agent's progress

4. [**Part 4: Results and Artifacts Display**](./frontend-implementation-guide-part4.md)
   - Results summary and detailed output display
   - Session recording (GIF) player
   - Screenshots gallery and artifacts list

## Implementation Approach

1. Start by implementing the core status component (Part 1) to display basic agent information
2. Add the logs component (Part 2) for detailed activity tracking
3. Implement the browser session timeline (Part 3) for a visual overview
4. Finally, add the results and artifacts display (Part 4) for viewing outcomes

These components should be integrated into your existing tab structure or layout system. Each component is designed to work independently, allowing for incremental implementation.

## API Endpoints Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/agents/:id` | GET | Get agent details |
| `/api/v1/agents/:id/logs` | GET | Get agent logs (supports pagination) |
| `/api/v1/agents/:id/results` | GET | Get agent execution results |
| `/api/v1/agents/:id/artifacts` | GET | Get agent artifacts (screenshots, etc.) |
| `/api/v1/agents/:id/stats` | GET | Get agent statistics |

## WebSocket Events

The application also emits several WebSocket events that can be used for real-time updates:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `agent-status-update` | Emitted when an agent's status changes |
| `agent-log-update` | Emitted when a new log entry is added |
| `agent-result-update` | Emitted when results are updated |

Consider subscribing to these events for real-time updates on the details page.
